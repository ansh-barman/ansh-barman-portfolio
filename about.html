            <p>Hey! a bit strange innit? So About me huh, I'm basically a nerd.
                I guess you can call me that, as if anything is related to tech or cars
                I'm the go to person for everyone close to me. When it comes to cars,
                I am someone who loves cars so much that I live and die car.<br><br>
                So, for an introduction, I am Ansh Barman, based in Delhi. I've completed
                my higher secondary schooling from Air Force Bal Bharti School and my Senior secondary
                from Masonic Public School. <br><br>In my school days I was very enthusiastic and participated
                in several co-curricular activities like debates, presentations, exhibitions, NCC, etc.
                All these activities helped me gain the basic command over my communication skills and stuff.
                <br><br>After my 12th, I'm currently pursuing my final year Btech in CSE from Dronacharya college
                of Engineering. If we talk about my hobbies I have a keen interest in latest technologies and
                automobiles.
                Also, I love to cook and write and as you may have observed by now I'm a pretty fun
                loving person and I like to interact with new people so, if you want to connect with me
                then please reach out to me on my LinkedIn / Instagram / Mail. See you there!
            </p><br>
